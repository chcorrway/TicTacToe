# TicTacToe
TicTacToe Project with processing &amp; IntelliJ

2 versions of this app, 1 is on IntelliJ and is the basic build with only the necessary code.

the other is a pure processing version, only open with the processing text editor, this is so we can make more files and organise 
the code a lot easier than IntelliJ.


Note: for IntelliJ be sure to add the processing Library (aka core.jar) to the project.
