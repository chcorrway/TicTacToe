# TicTacToe
TicTacToe Project with processing &amp; IntelliJ

2 versions of this app, 1 is on IntelliJ and is the basic build with only the necessary code plus comments on how I made this and my thought process. (I have done this because I find the restrat on mousePressed complicated and wanted to better understand it for myself and others)

The other is a pure processing version, only open with the processing text editor, this is so we can make more files and organise 
the code a lot easier than IntelliJ.


Note: for IntelliJ be sure to add the processing Library (aka core.jar) to the project.

Processing version is not very differnet from the IntellliJ version for now, but stay tuned for updates. I plan to make a main menu, game settings, general settings, score board, restart/return to menu button, A.I., and more...
